      "The care you provide for others may be driving you to seek therapy, whether due to burnout, compassion fatigue, imposter syndrome, people-pleasing tendencies, or perfectionism. Whether you're in pre-professional school, undergoing training, or reflecting on a long career in healthcare, we can address the unique stressors of your professional environment along with any challenges you may be facing in other areas of your life.",
